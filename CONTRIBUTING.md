## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Familiarity with cross-platform development

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/termos.git
   cd termos
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest termos/tests.py
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all public methods
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example Code Style:
```python
def connect_network(self, ssid: str, password: str = None) -> None:
    """Connect to a WiFi network.
    
    Args:
        ssid: Network name to connect to
        password: Network password (optional for open networks)
    """
    if self.os_type == "Windows":
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
